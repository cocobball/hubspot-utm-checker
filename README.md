## Overview

Cory's UTM Extractor is a Chrome extension designed to scrape and tally specific UTM parameters from all the links on the current webpage. This tool is especially useful for digital marketers, SEO specialists, and data analysts who want to quickly gather insights into the UTM parameters

## Why This Extension?

This extension was developed out of a specific need: HubSpot's form reporting doesn't provide an easy way to pull UTM data. The traditional methods were slow and cumbersome. Cory's UTM Extractor offers a quick and efficient solution to this problem, making it easier to extract and analyze this crucial data.

- **Google Jobs Apply Count**: Counts the number of links with the UTM source as 'google_jobs_apply'.
